# This project contains two programs for the coding challenge from LightFeather.io

ShiftCipher

- Encode and Decode Strings using a Shift Cipher AKA Ceasar Shift.

RegistrationForm

- Simple Registration form and validation

DEPENDENCIES:

- Both programs use node.js and were developed using node 12.0.0
- Please see my [Design Doc](Design.md) for more information.

To Execute ShiftCipher, start in the root folder then:

    cd ShiftCipher
    node .
    
Then use the [postmain application](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to load the postman project provided in the ShiftCipher, to call the api to apply the shift cipher and I've also suplied an api to decode the cipher.

To Execute Registration form go back to the root then:

    cd RegistrationForm
    node .

then navigate to localhost and the Registration form will come up.
